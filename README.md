Sorting Visualizer
Overview
This project is a Sorting Visualizer built with Next.js. It provides a visual demonstration of 5 popular sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Users can visualize how these algorithms work step by step through animations, making it a helpful tool for understanding sorting algorithms in an interactive way.

Features
Real-time Visualizations: Watch the sorting process unfold with smooth animations.
Multiple Algorithms: Choose from 5 different sorting algorithms.
Customizable Speed: Adjust the speed of the animations to suit your preference.
Responsive Design: The visualizer adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
Next.js: Framework for building server-rendered React applications.
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS/SCSS/Tailwind CSS: For styling the visual elements and ensuring responsiveness.
JavaScript: Core language for implementing sorting algorithms.
Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Quick Sort: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around it.
Merge Sort: A stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
Insertion Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next item and inserting it into the correct position.
Selection Sort: A comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and places it in its correct position.
